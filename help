Tips:
	-If a note that you want to read using readnote doesn't exist, you will be asked to create one using newnote.
	-If a note that you want to write with quicknote already exists, you will be asked to read it using readnote.
	-If you type a blank note name in readnote, you will automatically create a new note. You can do this if you want to take a note but you are using readnote.
	-Deleting notes using delnote won't send the files to Trash. They will be deleted forever, so don't store other files in your Notes folder.
	-Even if you don't have a Notes folder, shellnotes will make one for you.
	-No matter in which directory you are, shellnotes will work from everywhere - and when your done taking notes, you will get back on your previous working directory!
	-If you want to check if shellnotes is working proprely, try typing "shellnotes" in the terminal!
	-If you want to delete all your notes inside your folder, type "delnote -all".

	1. Type findnote in your terminal and try to locate the file in your Notes folder.
	2. Try using findmisplacednote to check if your note is in the wrong location.
	3. Try listing your notes with listnotes and check if your note is there, maybe you renamed it.
	4. Try navigating into your Notes folder, then showing hidden files. Maybe the note is hidden.
