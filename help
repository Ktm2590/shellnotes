Tips:
	-If a note that you want to read using readnote doesn't exist, you will be asked to create one using newnote.
	-If a note that you want to write with quicknote already exists, you will be asked to read it using readnote.
	-If you type a blank note name in readnote, you will automatically create a new note. You can do this if you want to take a note but you are using readnote.
	-Deleting notes using delnote won't send the files to Trash. They will be deleted forever, so don't store other files in your Notes folder.
	-Even if you don't have a Notes folder, shellnotes will make one for you.
	-No matter in which directory you are, shellnotes will work from everywhere - and when your done taking notes, you will get back on your previous working directory!
