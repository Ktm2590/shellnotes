Tips:
	-If a note that you want to read using readnote doesn't exist, you will be asked to create one using newnote.
	-If a note that you want to write with quicknote already exists, you will be asked to read it using readnote.
	-If you type a blank note name in readnote, you will automatically create a new note. You can do this if you want to take a note but you are using readnote.
	-Deleting notes using delnote won't send the files to Trash. They will be deleted forever, so don't store other files in your Notes folder.
	-Even if you don't have a Notes folder, shellnotes will make one for you.
	-No matter in which directory you are, shellnotes will work from everywhere - and when your done taking notes, you will get back on your previous working directory!
	-If you want to check if shellnotes is working proprely, try typing "shellnotes" in the terminal!
	-If you want to delete all your notes inside your folder, type "delnote -all".
	-If quickread shows nothing, your Note must be blank.

Don't seem to find your note? Try these steps:
	1. Type findnote in your terminal and try to locate the file in your Notes folder.
	2. Try using findmisplacednote to check if your note is in the wrong location.
	3. Try listing your notes with listnotes and check if your note is there, maybe you renamed it.
	4. Try navigating into your Notes folder, then showing hidden files. Maybe the note is hidden.

Changing default editors:
	Changing editors is a feature enabled in shellnotes <1.0. In case the user wants to change the 
	default editors, he must change the NOTES_EDITOR and QUICK_NOTES_EDITOR values from the code. These are two variables that the rest of the code uses to check the default editor for commands like newnote and quicknote. This means that if you change the name of the program the variables are going to search for, the code will use your prefered editor. In case the name is incorrect, problems may occur.

	Default editors:
		for newnote: gedit (ubuntu default)
		for quicknote: nano (in-terminal experience)
	Suggested editors other than default:
		for newnote: Sublime text, Atom
		for quicknote: Vim

Changing default Notes Folder:
	Changing default folder is a feature enabled in shellnotes <2.5. In case the user wants to change the default folder to store/write/list/rename/read/delete his notes, he must change the DEFAULT_PATH value from the code (found in line 9). This is a variable that the rest of the code uses to check the default folder for all the commands to make change in the right directory. This means that if you change the name of the path the variable is going to search for, the code will use your prefered folder. In case the path is incorrect, problems may occur.
